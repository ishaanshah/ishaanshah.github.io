## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hi! I am a Dual Degree student at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in).
I work on human body and loose clothing reconstrucion at [CVIT, IIIT-H](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in) with [Dr. Avinash Sharma](https://3dcomputervision.github.io).
I have previously worked on procedural tree generation.

I am also exploring the related field of Computer Graphics. I am specifically interested in real-time rendering.
I am currently working on accurate real-time rendering of layered materials with [Aakash KT](https://aakashkt.github.io).

Apart from this, I have been working on the problem of hand reconstrucion with [Dr. Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/).

I have previously worked as an intern at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/labs/india/) and [Metabrainz Foundation](https://metabrainz.org/) (GSoC 2020).
Apart from my research interests, I love building well-designed, well-written, and helpful software systems. Take a look a the [projects](/projects) page to find projects Iâ€™ve worked on.
