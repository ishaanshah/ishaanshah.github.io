## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hi! I am a 5<sup>th</sup> year Dual Degree student at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in) supervised by [Dr. P. J. Narayanan](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~pjn/).

My research revolves around light transport theory and material appearance modelling. Specifically, I am interested in
combining stochastic and analytic methods to improve rendering algorithms. Check out the [publications](/publications) page
to get to know more about my research.

I have previously worked as an intern at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/labs/india/) and [Metabrainz Foundation](https://metabrainz.org/) (GSoC 2020).
Apart from my research interests, I love building well-designed, well-written, and helpful software systems. Take a look a the [projects](/projects) page to find projects Iâ€™ve worked on.
